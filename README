-- USAGE --
1. Re-write the code of the HTML nested list, in the same format using, using your own anchor texts, titles and links of course.

2. Create a small image which will indicate if a list has any child items. You should also create another similar image to indicate when that parent list is focused or has a child item which is focused.

3. Add the content of menu.css to your main stylesheet and adjust the styles to match the rest of your existing styles. Remember to change the stylesheet link in HTML to match your existing stylesheet.

IMPORTANT - The link to the jQuery library and the IE6 conditional statement must stay in the <head> of the HTML in order for the list to be accessible in IE6.
